## About our project
>An autonomous robot that is capable of **mapping areas** around itself, **sending the map data** to a storage location to be built into a feasible 2D map capable of tracking where and when routes happened. This idea designated Mini Robotic 2D Mapper (MR2M) was further supported by the realization that there were many diverse potential ways the product could go, these ways included but were not limited to, autonomous space mapping, and the mapping and navigation of cave systems. 
- Since the project is currently in its startup phase, our team is attempting to build an MR2M robot with minimal materials and deploying it within a safe environment.
